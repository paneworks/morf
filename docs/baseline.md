caelestia specs fail where they failed before this work began (settings_theme, sound_theme, power_bar_theme, net_pages_theme, planner, planner_typography, lule_theme, lule, auth_desktop, auth_outputs, bar_theme, bottom_theme, connectivity_theme, graphs, keyboard_theme, network_typography, one caelestia_spec case; accessible_spec needs the a11y bus).
